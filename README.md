Final Assignment for Developing Data Products (Coursera)

This repo contains the source for my STOCK TRENDS SHINY APP which is an assignment for the Coursera Developing Data Products Course.  

This shiny app allows viewing and experimenting with (small) stock portfolios. You can edit a set of ticker 
symbols, view the performance of various stock sectors, and adjust time range and choose between two performance metrics.  
  
The actual app is available at: <http://steveguttman.shinyapps.io/Stock_Trends/>  
A Slidy presentation about the app is available here: <http://rpubs.com/sguttman/stock_trends>
